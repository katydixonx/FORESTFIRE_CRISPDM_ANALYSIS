Step 1 - Business Understanding

Project Objective
Develop predictive models to identify whether the burned area of a forest fire exceeds 4%. This is a binary classification problem.

Context
Predicting fire severity helpe the fire management team to prepare resources, improve safety, and reduce ecological damage.

Stakeholders
- Forestry agencies
- Emergency planners
- Environmental science teams

Success Criteria
- A model that has a reliable generalisation performance
- Correct handling of train/validate/test splits
- Strong classification accuracy and good confusion matrix performance
- Able to identify drivers of severe fire

This stage outlines the problem, te goal of the modelling, and how success will be measured before analysis begins. 

Loaded the forest fire into dataset. Checked orange's automatically assigned variable types and target roles. Initial inspections.
